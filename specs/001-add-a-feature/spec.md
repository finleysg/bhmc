## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a golf club member who participates in skins games, I want to access a dedicated page where I can
view my complete skins account history, current balance, and manage my payout preferences, so that I
can track my earnings and control when I receive cash payments.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am a logged-in player with skins earnings, **When** I navigate to /my-skins, **Then**
   I should see my current skins cash balance prominently displayed at the top of the page
2. **Given** I am viewing my skins account page, **When** I select a specific season from the season
   filter, **Then** I should see all my skins winnings for that season
3. **Given** I am viewing my skins account page with a season selected, **When** the page loads my
   winnings data, **Then** I should see the total dollar amount of all skins won for that season
4. **Given** I am viewing my skins account page, **When** I select a specific season from the season
   filter, **Then** I should see all my transactions (wins, cash-outs, adjustments) for that season
5. **Given** I am viewing my account settings section, **When** I change my payout frequency
   preference, **Then** the system should save my new preference and display a confirmation
6. **Given** I am a player with no skins activity, **When** I access /my-skins, **Then** I should
   see a friendly message indicating no activity and current balance of $0

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a player has skins activity but zero current balance?
- How does the system handle seasons where a player had no activity?
- What occurs if payout preference update fails?
- How are pending transactions displayed while they're being processed?
