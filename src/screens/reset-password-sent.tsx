            If you don&apos;t receive a reset link within a few minutes, check to ensure that your
            email client is not routing email from bhmc.org to junk or spam. If we don&apos;t have
            an account record with this email, that would be another reason you might not receive a
            reset link. In that case, please <Link to="/session/account">create an account</Link>.
